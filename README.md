# Garbage_Classification

## This is a collection of my personal research project files, including the research paper "Report.pdf", a presentation video, the source code file and a folder of dataset used.

### This study is aimed to build three different machine learning models: CNN, XGBoost, and logistic regression to ac- complish garbage image classification. CNN also uses the transfer learning from ResNet50 to make the training more efficient and accurate. The data set used for deep learning structures has a total of 2527 images with 6 different classes, which is divided into training, validation, and test sets. Finally, the performances of the three models measured in accuracy are compared. CNN and XGBoost have the potential to do well on this task, but logistic regression is not suitable.
